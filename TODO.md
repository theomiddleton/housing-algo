- [ ] Split rooms for couple (One good, One bad)
- [ ] Use images for room score?
  - [ ] Score each room based on its image.
  - [ ] Provide an output on which images reviewed, and which discarded (common areas)
- [ ] Adjust algorithm
  - [ ] Bed
    - [x] Couples are prioritized for a double bed, but if the relationship is internal and there is >=1 single bed, a member of the couple is strongly prioritized for a single bed.
    - [ ] Those currently living in a room with a single bed are prioritized for a single bed.
    - [x] Couples external couples are prioritized for a double bed over single people.
  - [x] First floor more attractive than ground floor
    - [x] First floor higher safety score than ground floor
      - [x] Back of house higher safety score than front of house (More so for ground floor)
  - [x] Change ground floor safety score to safetyConcern rather than tied to gender
  - [x] Add distance to Kitchen as low weight - close/far
  - [ ] Normalise weights 
  - [ ] Finding house and dealing with agents should have equal weights
  - [x] Potentially change bonus from multiplier to fixed bonus
  - [ ] Brief Housemates on this algo, agree on weights and rules
  - [x] Remove determanism based on input ordering. Algorithm determanism should be independent of input ordering
  - [ ] Re-Review through chat
  - [ ] Add bypass to certain parts of the algorithm, eg, ignore kitchenProximity or floor level
- [ ] Add entropy mode
- [ ] Thinking flag for ai
- [ ] Review

- [ ] Add a council mode - runs both deterministic modes, a few runs with entropy, and an AI council (3+ models from different labs)
  - [ ] Council mixer algorithm
    - [ ] Deterministic 
    - [ ] AI

- [ ] Create a simple static website explaining the algorithm and its parameters.
  - [ ] Ai explanation of each parameter, its positive and negative effects and importantly biases
